The second line  creates an empty list to store data from the file that we opened on the Fremont bridge data .The third line of code is putting all lines from the file into a list. The fourth line of data is closing the Bridge file, closing the file is a corteous and clean thing to do.

    "The minimum number that I got for the dataset on the amount of bikers that went across the fremont bridge is 425 people, going east, and 466 going west. Since I have a fairly small dataset, I am able to look back on the exact date both of those numbers came from. It looks like both of those numbers came from the september 6th. I looked up online what day of this week this day was and it said it was a sunday. This raises numerous questions which will be shown below. Additionally I can conclude that on this particular day there was less bike traffic on the fremont bridge. Additionally, I found that the maxmum number of bikers crossing the bridge,unlike the minimum were on seperate days. The maximum number of bikers going East was the day before the maximum number of bikers going west. The last numbers that I found was important was the median and average number of bikers going west and east. I found that the average number of bikers going west is around 1497 and the average number going east is around 1540. Knowing this allows me to conclude that on average there were more bikers going east. Lastly, I found the median numbers for the bikers were less important, but the numbers were, 1648 people going going east and around 1573 going west.\n",
